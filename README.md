# Task: City Information API 

## Description
This repository contains the code and resources for the City Information API task. The goal of this task is to build a Spring Boot application that utilizes a public free API to provide various endpoints for retrieving information about cities, countries, and currency conversion.

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. The project is built using Java 8 or higher.
4. Build the project to download the required dependencies and compile the source code. You can use your IDE's build command or run the following command in the project's root directory:
